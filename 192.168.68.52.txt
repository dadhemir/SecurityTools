Based on the scan results provided for the host running Linux kernel versions between 2.6.9 and 2.6.33, there are several security risks that need to be addressed. Here's an analysis of each open port and the associated recommendations:

### General Recommendations:
1. **Kernel Update:** The Linux kernel version 2.6.9 - 2.6.33 is outdated and prone to many vulnerabilities. It is highly recommended to update the kernel to a more recent version that has better security patches.

2. **Service Patching:** Ensure that all services and their associated software are updated to the latest versions to address any known vulnerabilities.

3. **Access Control:** Restrict access to these services using firewalls (IPtables, firewalld) only to trusted IP addresses.

4. **Network Segmentation:** Implement network segmentation to limit lateral movement within the network in case of a breach.

5. **Monitoring and Logging:** Enable logging and monitoring for all critical services to detect any suspicious activities.

### Specific Port Recommendations:

1. **FTP (Port 21 & Port 2121):** 
   - **vsftpd 2.3.4 and ProFTPD 1.3.1** are outdated and known to have several vulnerabilities.
   - **Recommendation:** Disable FTP if not necessary; consider using SFTP which is more secure. If FTP is needed, update to the latest versions and enforce strong authentication mechanisms.

2. **SSH (Port 22):** 
   - **OpenSSH 4.7p1** is outdated.
   - **Recommendation:** Update to a newer version (OpenSSH 8.x or above) and enforce strong authentication methods like key-based authentication.

3. **Telnet (Port 23):**
   - **Legacy protocol, unencrypted.**
   - **Recommendation:** Disable Telnet and use SSH instead for encrypted communications.

4. **SMTP (Port 25):**
   - **Postfix smtpd** should be regularly updated.
   - **Recommendation:** Ensure Postfix is updated and configured to prevent open relay and enforce TLS for secure email transmission.

5. **DNS (Port 53):** 
   - **ISC BIND 9.4.2** is outdated.
   - **Recommendation:** Update BIND to the latest version to address security vulnerabilities.
   - **Additional:** Consider using DNSSEC to protect against DNS spoofing.

6. **HTTP (Port 80 & Port 8180):**
   - **Apache 2.2.8** and **Tomcat/Coyote JSP 1.1** are outdated.
   - **Recommendation:** Upgrade Apache to version 2.4.x or above, and Tomcat to the latest version.
   - **Additional:** Enable HTTPS and ensure the certificates are valid and regularly updated.

7. **RPC (Port 111 and Port 2049):**
   - **rpcbind** and **NFS** should be minimized or properly secured if used.
   - **Recommendation:** Disable RPC services if not required, or implement strong access controls.

8. **NetBIOS (Port 139 & Port 445):**
   - **Samba 3.X - 4.X** services.
   - **Recommendation:** Ensure Samba is updated and properly configured to restrict access and prevent anonymous access.

9. **RSH/Rexec/Login (Port 512, Port 513, and Port 514):**
   - **Legacy protocols with known security issues.**
   - **Recommendation:** Disable these services and replace them with more secure options like SSH.

10. **Java-RMI (Port 1099):**
    - **GNU Classpath grmiregistry** can be vulnerable.
    - **Recommendation:** Ensure it is properly secured and consider limiting its exposure to internal networks only.

11. **Bindshell (Port 1524):**
    - **Metasploitable root shell** indicates a backdoor or highly vulnerable service.
    - **Recommendation:** Remove this service immediately as it indicates a severe security risk.

12. **Database Services (Port 3306 - MySQL, and Port 5432 - PostgreSQL):**
    - **Outdated versions.**
    - **Recommendation:** Update MySQL to 5.7 or later and PostgreSQL to the latest stable release.
    - **Additional:** Ensure database access is restricted and enforce strong authentication.

13. **VNC (Port 5900):**
    - **Protocol 3.3 is outdated** and insecure.
    - **Recommendation:** Update VNC to the latest version and enforce authentication and encryption.

14. **X11 (Port 6000):**
    - **Access denied** is good, but X11 should not be exposed.
    - **Recommendation:** Disable direct access via port 6000 or tunnel X11 over SSH.

15. **IRC (Port 6667):**
    - **UnrealIRCd** can be exploited if outdated.
    - **Recommendation:** Ensure it is updated to the latest version, and restrict access.

16. **Apache Jserv (Port 8009):**
    - **AJP13 protocol.**
    - **Recommendation:** Secure the AJP connector and ensure it's updated.

### Conclusion:
The scan indicates numerous outdated services and protocols which present security risks. Immediate action is required in terms of patching, updating, disabling unnecessary services, and implementing robust security configurations. Regular vulnerability assessments and a comprehensive patch management strategy will also be crucial for ongoing security.
